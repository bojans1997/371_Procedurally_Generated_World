FEATURES
=========================

- The application opens a 1024x768 window which contains a 100x100 square grid.
- There are 5 models in the grid, each containing the third letter of our first names and the fourth digit of our student IDs.
- The X, Y, and Z axes are marked with red, green, and blue lines in the middle of the grid.
- The models can be rotated, scaled up and down, and moved along the XY plane.
- The world orientation can be rotated and moved up and down.
- The camera can pan and tilt as well as zoom in and out.
- The rendering mode can be swapped between triangles, points, and lines.
